# Farm Computer

A Stardew Valley wiki parsing discord bot.

## Setup

**Make sure to clone with `--recurse-submodules` to get the logger submodule!!**

1. For the bot to run, a `config.json` file must be created and placed in the private directory. This establishes the settings for the bot. Examples are currently not provided, but they must match the layout specified in `src/config.py` and other files.
